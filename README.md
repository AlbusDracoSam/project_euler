# project_euler

Solutions of problems from projecteuler.net. I'll use a different language for each problem.

Example:

* Problem 1 - Python
* Problem 2 - Ruby
* Problem 3 - C

And so on.

I don't see any problem if you want to add a solution for Problem 1 using another language.
Just remember to create a separate folder for the problem, if it doesn't already exist, and add all solutions to the folder.
