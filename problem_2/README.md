Even Fibonacci numbers
======================

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Ruby
```ruby
ruby problem_2/solution.rb
       user     system      total        real
   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000009)
# => Answer: 4613732
```

### Python
```python
python problem_2/solution.py
